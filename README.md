## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
- Eye for detail! 
- Building of the app bones

### Weaknesses:
- JS loops! 
- Getting my info to render to the page consistantly

### Opportunities:
- Excited to make this fun and get a laugh
- Will add more as the project goes on.

### Threats:
- Using more than one Airtable
- Spiders...
- Will add more (serious ones, not just spiders)
