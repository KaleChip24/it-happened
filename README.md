# Project Overview

## Project Name

[Movie Meow-tian](https://github.com/KaleChip24/it-happened)

## Project Description

Sit back, find the sun spot and get some laughs as my cats give their take on all our favorit films featuring cats(no role is too small)! Movie Meow-tian is a React build that uses an Airtable to render data and allows users to add their own. The homepage movie icons will take the users to the meow-vie review and synopsis. There is a form page where your cat can leave their own review!
